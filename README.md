# Linked-List

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node. For example, You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first node a special name called HEAD. Also, the last node in the linked list can be identified because its next portion points to NULL. Linked lists can be of multiple types: singly, doubly, and circular linked list.
